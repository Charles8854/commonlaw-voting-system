Two Important Notes. 

1:	While the above Map is one of two vehickles which we are using 
to "Locally Organize" our "Responsibly Self-Governing Communities";
the tools presented on this web-page are also intended to be used 
to Establish "Self-Governing Communities" in manners which are both "Non-Geographical", & "Private".
These would be Communities which Share Common "Religious Beliefs", or "Racial Ancestory", 
or "Fraternal Organizations", or "Trade Unions", or "Political Parties"; 
or a potentially infininate-number of other communities whose members are thinly dispersed across larger geographical areas. 

Options for organizing under any or all of these differing forms of communities 
are presented to new users of this web-page during their registration process. 

2:	While this web-page focuses primarily on the USA, 
it is also designed to assist people every-where on this earth 
in movibg towards establishing their own "Responsibly Self-Governing Governmental-Structires".


****************************************************

 

“Special Government” Jurisdiction would be such non-geographical associations as
Religious Organizations; Fraternal Organizations such as the Masons, Elks, and Lions; and Trade-
Associations, such as the Lawyers “American Bar Associations”, and the Doctors “American Medical
Association”.

During the Years where-in our modern Organic Body-Politic of American People was originally Formed,
roughly 1760 - 1790; "Comunications Technology", was Extremely "Limited". 

The Heroic People who then fought & died in their efforts to escape 
the Un-Holy "English Empire Governing-Structure" which prompted our American "Declaration of Independence" document;
those people were not only severely Limited in their "Communications Technology",
but They Had also Sufffered Many Generations of "Dumbing-Down Propaganda" from those same evil sources.  

The First "Constitution" Document, as designed to Form a Governmental-Structure for our entire American People; 
was entitled as the "Articles of Confederation"; & that document was Very Compliant with 
Traditional "Anglo-American & Biblical Principles of Common-Law & Republicanism".

Our Second "Constitution" Document, as designed to Form a Governmental-Structure for our entire American People,
& as engineered in a closed-door meeting among mostly high-level Free-Masons, in Philagelphia, in 1787, 
was Less Compliant with those same Traditional "Anglo-American & Biblical Principles of Common-Law & Republicanism".

Multiple very plausible "Conspiracy Theories" can be launched from these words alone. 
But, multitudes of excellent books, articles, authors, & researchers, 
are modernly available, through which readers here may more fully explore those "Conspiracy Theories".

And all of that sort of "Conspiracy Research" is very helpful, in coming to a clear comprehension, 
of: the True Nature of "The Problem", which our modern American People face, 
concerning "How To Responsibly Self-Govern", under the concept of the "Rule of Law"; 
which, has Traditionally ammounted to, no more or less than, "Compliance" with 
"Principles of Republicanism & Common-Law".

As With-In the Frame-Work of our USA Constitutional "Republican-Model" for "Machinery-of-Government";
                our above Map is being used to Organize the Common-Law-Compliant People of the USA,
                in-to Responsibly Self-Governing Organic Body-Politic Local Communities.<br><br>

                But, please note, that 

                These are designed as Twelve Separate "Free & Independent Super-States";<br>
                each with their own "Bottom-Up" & "Natural/Organic" Hierarchal Structure;<br>
                & Fully Accountable to Their Own Local Constituents & Town Constables.
                <br><br>
                Many "Seats of Leadership" here-in are "Available "& "Open".<br>
                Pleade join with us; & choose your own level of involvement & commitment.
                <br><br>
                Each of Our Constituents thus Assembled Possess Fully Un-Separated
                Legislative, Executive, & Judicial Authority Powers; 
                & here-by, We do Organically Compose the Body-Politic of 
                a Legitimate & Re-Publican "General Congress" & "Supreme Court of Law";<br>
                both of which are functioning as a "Singular Entity", 
                & which are Proceeding "In the Name Of, & On the Behalf Of" our Common American People.
                <br><br>
                We are a full-time & real-time "Constitutional Convention".
                <br><br>
                We claim Lawful Authority to Exercise Juris-Diction over Any Sixth-Amendment Criminal-Case<br>
                which has Not Yet been Lawfully Adjudicated by any American Precinct/District or Higher Super-State
                Juris-Diction; 
                &, by the Unanimous Agreement of the Twelve Supreme Delegates/Representatives/Jurists Assembled
                here-from, 
                to Issue All Court Process Necessary to Secure "Justice" for our Common People.
                <br><br>
                To the best of our abilities; we will Bond to-gether, to responsibly assume<br>
                the Duties of "Qualified-Electors", in both our Local Townships & Precincts;<br>
                & also in our non-localized Private/Special/Religious/Ideological/Fraternal Communities.
                <br><br>
                This all in harmonious accord with our Organic/Traditional<br>
                Anglo/American Concept of the "Rule of Law" & "Federalism";<br>
                which is based solidly on those "Fundamental Principles" of "Responsible Self-Governing"<br>
                under these Concepts of "Natural Law" & "Higher Law" which have been affirmed in<br>
                our National & State "Constitution" documents, & in the Procedural Rules of "Due Process of Law" &
                "Common-Law".
                <br><br>
                All of this is the Source of our traditional Anglo/American Concept of<br>
                Governmental under a System of "Higher Law", which is Significantly "Superior To"<br>
                those "Statutory Codes" which are derived from the Traditions of the "Roman Empire",<br>
                & which Our Organic Anglo/American/Israelite Traditions Recognize as the Inferior "Rule of Men".<br>

The First Constitution of our American People was entitled as the "Articles of Confederation",
& that document    

This web-page is presenting many newly "Innovative Technologies"; 
not only as related to computing & web-page building,
but also as relating to social-organizing & community empowerment.
